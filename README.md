# Avoid the Crowd

Avoid the Crowd is a full stack web app that can assist people to find places of interest that are least crowded.
We wanted to create this app, especially during this pandemic, because we felt wanted the general public to safely find 
places where they can pick up groceries, get food at restaurants, and much more. After looking through many services, we 
were unsatisfied with the current services that they provided.

## How to Use

The user can type in a category name for the places of interest they are trying to find. Once they search, our app can return the 5 of the
closests location in order of busyness from least to greatest. From there, the user can look through the selection and heart, share or minimize the card list
